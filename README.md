# CARDANO-COSMOS-BRIDGE-INITIATIVE
Cardano ↔ Cosmos Bridge Initiative
 Vision

The goal is simple but powerful: to build a transparent, community-funded Cardano ↔ Cosmos IBC bridge.
We believe both ecosystems share the same values,  decentralization, security, and innovation,  and deserve to connect.

 Mission

To unite developers, communities, and supporters from both Cardano and Cosmos to design and fund a secure, open-source interoperability layer.

This bridge isn’t just about moving tokens,  it’s about building trust and cooperation between two of the most principled blockchain networks in existence.

 How We’re Funding It

All contributions are held in escrow, released only after clear milestones are achieved.
