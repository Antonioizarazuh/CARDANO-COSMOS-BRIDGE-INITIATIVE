🌉 ZKADA Labs — Trustless Zero-Knowledge Bridge (Cardano ↔ Cosmos)

ZKADA Labs is an open-source research initiative focused on designing the first trustless Zero-Knowledge interoperability bridge between Cardano and Cosmos/Osmosis.

This project aims to connect two of the most principled blockchain ecosystems through pure cryptography, not multisigs, custodians, or trusted validators.

🧭 Vision

To build a fully trustless, verifiable, and open Zero-Knowledge bridge that allows ADA to flow safely between Cardano and Cosmos — unlocking liquidity, DeFi access, IBC connectivity, and new economic possibilities.

Cardano and Cosmos share deep values: decentralization, security, community-driven development, and strong research foundations.

They deserve a bridge that respects those values.

💙 Mission

To unite builders, researchers, developers, and community supporters across ecosystems to design a secure, open, verifiable bridging architecture powered entirely by Zero-Knowledge proofs.

This bridge is not just about moving tokens —
it’s about building a trustless connection between two networks that emphasize security and correctness above all else.

🔐 Why Zero-Knowledge?

Traditional bridges rely on:

multisigs

custodial keys

centralized relayers

trusted operators

These models repeatedly fail.

ZKADA takes a different approach:

✔ ZK proofs validate chain state
✔ No human trust required
✔ No custodians or signatures
✔ Both chains can verify each other independently
✔ Open-source cryptographic guarantees

This is the future of interoperability.
