## 🌉 Cardano ↔ Cosmos Bridge Initiative  

### 🧭 Vision  
The goal is simple but powerful: to build a **transparent, community-funded Cardano ↔ Cosmos IBC bridge.**  
We believe both ecosystems share the same values — decentralization, security, and innovation — and deserve to connect.  

---

### 💙 Mission  
To unite developers, communities, and supporters from both Cardano and Cosmos to design and fund a secure, open-source interoperability layer.  

This bridge isn’t just about moving tokens — it’s about **building trust and cooperation** between two of the most principled blockchain networks in existence.  

---

### 💰 How We’re Funding It  
All contributions are held in **escrow**, released only after clear milestones are achieved.  

- **Multi-signature controlled**
