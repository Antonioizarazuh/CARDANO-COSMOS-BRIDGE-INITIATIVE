Project Overview — Original Bridge Concept (Historical Document)

This document preserves the original concept and mission of the early Cardano ↔ Cosmos Bridge Initiative, before the transition to the trustless Zero-Knowledge–based ZKADA architecture.

It exists for transparency, historical continuity, and community reference.

🌉 Cardano ↔ Cosmos Bridge Initiative (Legacy Vision)
🧭 Vision

The initial goal was simple but powerful:
to build a transparent, community-funded Cardano ↔ Cosmos IBC bridge.

Both ecosystems share the same core values:

decentralization

security

research-driven innovation

and they deserve a meaningful connection.

💙 Mission

To unite developers and community members from Cardano and Cosmos to design and fund an open-source interoperability layer.

The bridge was envisioned as more than token transfers —
it represented trust and cooperation between two highly principled blockchain networks.

💰 Early Funding Concept (Legacy Model)

Originally, the project explored a community escrow–based funding model:

multi-signature controlled wallets

transparent tracking of contributions

milestone-based releases

community verification of progress

These ideas served as the foundation but have now been replaced by the trustless ZKADA Zero-Knowledge architecture, which removes the need for escrow or multisigs.

🧩 Early Status Notes (Legacy)

At the time, the project had achieved:

Mission and structural definition

Conceptual escrow setup

Initial developer outreach

These steps helped shape the evolved ZKADA initiative.

🤝 How to Get Involved (Then)

Community members were invited to:

Follow updates on X/Twitter

Contribute feedback, ideas, or development

Share the initiative under #CardanoCosmosBridge

This helped build early awareness.
